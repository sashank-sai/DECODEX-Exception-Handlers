## SLIDE 1: Shock Diagnosis

**Title:** *"Metro Phase 2: Structural Break Detection"*

### What to show:
| Element | Content | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Shock Event** | Metro Phase 2 launched Jul 1, 2025 | Case brief |
| **Detection** | Stage 1 forecast vs Q3 actual: **+16.1% overall deviation** | [stage2_output.txt](file:///c:/Users/asus/Desktop/decodex/stage2_output.txt) line 18 |
| **Chart** | `s2_01_forecast_deviation.png` — the waterfall showing per-route deviation | `charts/stage2/` |

### Key data points to highlight:
- **Express routes surged +47-51%** above Stage 1 forecast (X66: +51.3%, X11: +49.3%, X28: +47.1%)
- **Feeder routes contracted -7 to -22%** below forecast (F18: -22.2%, F12: -8.9%)
- **City routes exceeded forecast +16-21%** (stable growth, not metro-driven)

### Shift Classification (bottom of slide):
| Shift Type | Finding |
|------------|---------|
| **Level Shift** | Express +29-32%, Feeder -18 to -31%, City stable |
| **Volatility Shift** | All routes LOWER volatility post-metro (pattern is predictable) |
| **Elasticity Shift** | Congestion→ridership sensitivity **doubled** (+101%) |
| **Congestion-Mediated** | Congestion ↑10.9%, Speed ↓6.3% despite metro (construction effect) |

### Classification verdict:
> **REGIME CHANGE — not a temporary shock.** Metro permanently redistributes demand from Feeder→Express.

## SLIDE 2: Model Recalibration Summary

**Title:** *"Forecast Recalibration: Stage 1 → Stage 2"*

### What to show:
| Element | Content | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Chart** | `s2_03_timeline_break.png` — timeline with break line, old vs revised forecast | `charts/stage2/` |
| **Method** | How we recalibrated (adjustment factors + classification logic) | `stage2_output.txt` lines 92-104 |

### Recalibration methodology (brief):
1. Computed Q3 forecast-vs-actual deviation per route
2. Classified each route: **Stable** (<5%), **Moderate Shift** (5-15%), **Regime Change** (>15%)
3. Applied adjustment factors:
   - Stable → Factor = 1.0 (no change)
   - Moderate → Factor = 1 + (50% of deviation) — assume half is permanent
   - Regime Change → Factor = 1 + (75% of deviation) — assume three-quarters permanent

### Revised Q4 Forecast (Oct-Dec 2025):
| Metric | Stage 1 | Stage 2 Revised | Change |
|--------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| **Q4 Total** | 2,999,357 | 3,366,963 | **+12.3%** |
| **Uncertainty** | ±5% | ±23.6% | Widened 4.7× |
| **Express X28** | 248,692 | 336,538 | **+35.3%** |
| **Express X11** | 250,205 | 342,668 | **+37.0%** |
| **Feeder F18** | 261,604 | 218,135 | **-16.6%** |

### Key statement:
> "We explicitly separate temporary shock (25%) from permanent regime change (75%) in our adjustment logic. The wider uncertainty band (±23.6%) reflects that we are 3 months into a new regime with limited post-shock data."

## SLIDE 3: Impact Quantification (Before vs After)

**Title:** *"Before vs After Metro: Quantified Impact Assessment"*

### What to show:
| Element | Content | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Chart** | `s2_02_demand_redistribution.png` — pie charts Pre/Post Metro | `charts/stage2/` |
| **Chart** | `s2_04_express_vs_feeder.png` — grouped bars H1 vs Q3 | `charts/stage2/` |

### Before vs After comparison table:
| Metric | Pre-Metro (H1 2025) | Post-Metro (Q3 2025) | Change |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|--------|
| Daily network demand | 31,172 | 31,566 | +1.3% |
| Express share | 24.2% | 31.0% | **+6.8pp** |
| Feeder share | 24.4% | 18.5% | **-5.9pp** |
| City share | 38.5% | 38.9% | +0.4pp |
| Intercity share | 12.9% | 11.7% | -1.2pp |
| Congestion level | 2.78 | 3.09 | +10.9% |
| Avg bus speed | 31.1 km/h | 29.2 km/h | -6.3% |
| Congestion elasticity | +720 pax/level | +1,447 pax/level | **+101%** |
| Network Pax/km | 144.0 | 146.1 | +1.5% |

### Key insight:
> "Total demand barely changed (+1.3%). But the **internal mix shifted dramatically**: Express absorbs 7pp more of network share, Feeder loses 6pp. This is a **redistribution, not contraction** — the same passengers now take different routes."

### Route-level overload status (post-Metro):
| Route | Pre Pax/km | Post Pax/km | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| X28 | 207 | **267** | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| X66 | 123 | **163** | 🔴 OVERLOADED |
| X11 | 113 | **145** | 🔴 OVERLOADED |
| F18 | 150 | **103** | 📉 Contracting |
| F12 | 88 | **70** | 📉 At Risk |

## SLIDE 4: Trade-Off Identification

**Title:** *"Trade-Offs in Post-Metro Response"*

### What to show:
| Element | Content | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Chart** | `s2_05_fleet_revision.png` — Stage 1 vs Stage 2 fleet allocation | `charts/stage2/` |

### Three core trade-offs to present:

#### Trade-Off 1: Express Capacity vs Feeder Viability
| Give | Get | Risk |
|------|-----|------|
| Reduce Feeder from 21 → 15 buses | Express grows from 21 → 26 buses | F18 headway reaches **29 min**, F12 reaches **44 min** — barely viable |

> "Every bus moved to Express *improves* 3,300+ daily rider experience, but *degrades* 1,800 Feeder riders' service."

#### Trade-Off 2: Headway Improvement vs Coverage
| Action | Benefit | Cost |
|--------|---------|------|
| Tighten X28 headway 20→11 min | 38% better frequency for 3,335 daily riders | C04 + F12 go from 20 min to 35-44 min headway |

> "High-demand corridors get premium service, but low-demand corridors approach minimum viable service levels."

#### Trade-Off 3: Short-Term Reallocation vs Fleet Expansion
| Option | Speed | Cost | Sustainability |
|--------|-------|------|----------------|
| Budget-neutral reallocation | Immediate | ₹0 | Buys 60-90 days |
| Procure 8-10 new buses | 60-90 days | ~₹16-20 Cr | 12-18 month solution |
| Hybrid (reallocate now + procure) | Both | ~₹16-20 Cr | Recommended |

> "Reallocation alone is insufficient for Winter Peak (Nov-Dec). Express demand grew +50% — you cannot solve a 50% surge by moving 6 buses."

### Key statement:
> "We recommend the **hybrid approach**: reallocate 11 buses immediately as a bridge, while initiating procurement of 8-10 buses for Express corridor capacity by November 2025."

## SLIDE 5: Stage 3 Optimization Direction

**Title:** *"Stage 3 Direction: Optimization Under Metro Regime"*

### What to show:
| Element | Content | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Chart** | `s2_06_shift_classification.png` — Level vs Volatility scatter | `charts/stage2/` |

### Three optimization axes we anticipate for Stage 3:

#### 1. Feeder-Metro Integration
- Feeder routes F18 and F12 are **contracting structurally** — not recoverable
- Optimization direction: **Restructure** feeders as metro-connector routes (not compete with metro)
- Key question: Which stops should become metro feeder termini?

#### 2. Express Corridor Scaling
- All 3 Express routes are at **OVER-CAPACITY** even after reallocation
- Optimization direction: **Dedicated bus lanes** + fleet expansion on X28 corridor
- Key question: What is the optimal Express fleet size given the new demand regime?

#### 3. Dynamic Demand Management
- Congestion elasticity **doubled** post-metro — demand is more volatile with congestion
- Optimization direction: **Dynamic headway triggers** that deploy extra buses when congestion > Level 3
- Key question: How many buses should be held as a dynamic reserve?

### What we are NOT ready to commit to (per guidelines):
- Final fleet numbers (need Q4 actuals to confirm regime permanence)
- Route restructuring specifics (need Stop-level Metro proximity data)
- Capital expenditure recommendations (need cost-benefit under new regime)

### Closing statement:
> "The Metro Phase 2 structural break is confirmed, classified, and quantified. Our models are recalibrated. The Stage 3 challenge will be **optimizing the new equilibrium** — not fighting the shift, but designing a bus network that complements the metro rather than competes with it."
